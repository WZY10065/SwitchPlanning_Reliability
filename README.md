# IJEPES_SwitchPlanning_Reliability

Due to the limitation of paper, this program is the auxiliary material of the paper "Explicit Reliability Incorporated Switches Planning of Smart Distribution System with High Flexibility". The excel file contains the appendix of . The word file mainly contains a 6-node illustrative example and detailed disscussion of fictitious power flow constrains.

# Details of numberical analysis (excel file)
* Different configuration
* Detailed comparison between power flow constraint and no power flow constraint
* Detialed calculation result of 37-node, 85-node, 137-node and 417-node case
* Detailed calculation result of DNS switch planning model with reliability objective
