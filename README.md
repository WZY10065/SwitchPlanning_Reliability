# IJEPES_SwitchPlanning_Reliability

This supplementary material provides supporting data and analysis for the paper **'Explicit Reliability Incorporated Switches Planning of Smart Distribution System with High Flexibility'**. The Excel file contains complete topological information for four test systems (39, 85, 137, and 417), while the Word document offers an in-depth discussion of fictitious power flow constraints, including their mathematical formulation and implementation details.

# Details of numberical analysis (excel file)
* Different configuration
* Detailed comparison between power flow constraint and no power flow constraint
* Detialed calculation result of 37-node, 85-node, 137-node and 417-node case
* Detailed calculation result of DNS switch planning model with reliability objective
